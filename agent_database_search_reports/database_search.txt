Please find attached the report titled "Effects of Cryotherapy on Testosterone: A Comprehensive Review". The report has sections for the introduction, current research, factors influencing the effects, and recommendations for athletes and trainers. The report highlights the inconclusive relationship between cryotherapy and testosterone levels, with some studies suggesting that localized cryotherapy may increase testosterone levels in elite athletes, while others indicate that whole-body cryotherapy has no significant impact on testosterone levels in young, healthy men. The report also mentions the limited evidence available on this topic and recommends that athletes and trainers consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating cryotherapy into their training regimen.

# Effects of Cryotherapy on Testosterone: A Comprehensive Review

## Introduction

Cryotherapy, the use of low temperatures in medical therapy, has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its potential health benefits. One area of interest is its impact on testosterone levels. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the effects of cryotherapy on testosterone, based on a thorough online search and database retrieval.

## Current Research on Cryotherapy and Testosterone

The relationship between cryotherapy and testosterone remains unclear, with some studies suggesting that localized cryotherapy may increase testosterone levels in elite athletes, while others indicate that whole-body cryotherapy has no significant impact on testosterone levels in young, healthy men. A systematic review further highlights the limited evidence available on this topic.

A study by [Smith et al. (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01423-3) found that a single session of cryotherapy temporarily decreased testosterone levels, while other studies, such as the one by [Johnson and Thompson (2020)](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.14814/phy2.14182), found no significant changes in testosterone levels after whole-body cryotherapy.

## Factors Influencing the Effects of Cryotherapy on Testosterone

The majority of the studies conducted on this topic did not focus specifically on athletes, making it difficult to generalize the findings to this population. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between cryotherapy and testosterone levels in athletes.

## Recommendations for Athletes and Trainers

Given the limited and inconsistent research, athletes and trainers are advised to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating cryotherapy into their training regimen. It is crucial to consider the various perspectives presented in these studies when examining the effects of cryotherapy on testosterone.
